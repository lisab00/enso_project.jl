This package provides tools to train Echo State Networks and Neural Differential Equations to predict dynamical systems. The notebooks in the scripts folder explore the package's functionalities on a concrete example, i.e. the prediction of the El Nino - Southern Oscillation. The relevant data can be found in the data folder. We aim to compare both methods regarding their prediction accuracy and conclude that the Echo State Network yields a better prediction performance, despite its simplicity.
